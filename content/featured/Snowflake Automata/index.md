The Corrective RAG on Snowflake Documentation project is a data-driven GenAI solution designed to support analytical teams by enabling accurate, context-rich retrieval of technical content from Snowflake’s documentation. The project centers around building a robust information retrieval pipeline that supports decision-making, self-service analytics, and faster data onboarding.
At its core, the system uses a LangGraph-based architecture to orchestrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows, combining structured document indexing with corrective mechanisms like document relevance grading, fallback web search (via Tavily), and query rewriting for improved precision. Data is parsed, enriched, and filtered before being surfaced through a responsive Streamlit interface, providing end-users with validated and traceable insights.
This project exemplifies modern data engineering practices — from knowledge extraction and orchestration logic to the use of feedback loops for optimizing information quality. It highlights how LLMs can be operationalized for scalable analytics support, technical enablement, and internal knowledge exploration within cloud data platforms like Snowflake.
