Developed a full-stack data pipeline and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to power Bruno, an AI chatbot providing mental health support. Designed a multi-threaded ingestion framework in Dagster to extract mental health blogs, which were semantically structured using GPT-3.5 and stored in Snowflake via a schema extraction layer. Leveraged dbt for data transformation and built a robust RAG pipeline with LangChain, Chroma vector store, and Cohere's re-ranking service to improve context relevance.
